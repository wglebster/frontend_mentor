## Overview
This is the first Frontendmentor challenge I have completed. No difficulties with HTML or CSS, but my JS coding needs improvement. JS code works, but it's not pretty. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## What I learned

I got stuck a few times writing JS code and it still isn't how I want it to be, but it works. 

So far I've been doing a lot of tutorials and this coding challenge was the first time I've written my own JS code - it was a great experience, a bit intimidating at first but it got better after the first few lines.

I struggled getting all the `<li>` elements into an array, but then I discovered Array.from() as below

```js
Array.from(document.querySelectorAll("li"));
```
which wasn't covered in any of my tutorials. 

### Continued development

I do need to practice more JS, especially using loops to manipulate arrays of elements. 
I will be adding Bootstrap to my arsenal to make styling more stramlined, but not before I learn front-end React.
